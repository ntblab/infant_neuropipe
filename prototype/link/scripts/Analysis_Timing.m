%% Analyse the timing information for each experiment to make timing files
%
% When collecting data from infants, each session is unpredictable. This
% means the same consistency we expect from adult scans cannot be expected
% with infants. To accommodate the unpredictability the 'Analysis_Timing.m'
% script has the *very* hard job of searching through all of the timing
% data stored in the matlab file output by Experiment Menu (including block
% onset times and TR trigger times), as well as the eye tracking timing. It
% then uses all this information to determine when blocks start and stop,
% which blocks to exclude and how to use any condition or behavioral data
% to generate timing files.
%
% This script is very important and so should be understood. For a thorough
% description of how this script works, refer to
% $SUBJ_DIR/scripts/Analysis_Timing_functions/README.md
%
% Relatively completed: C Ellis 5/31/16
% Moved to the cluster: C Ellis 9/12/16
% Reorganized and made more components functions: C Ellis 10/12/16
% Updated to deal with nuisance epochs: C Ellis 3/23/17
% Reordered when timing files are created and made pseudoruns possible: C Ellis 2/27/18
