# ASHS configuration and parameter file
# -------------------------------------
#
# This file contains default settings for ASHS. Users can make a copy of this
# file and change parameters to better suit their data. To use this file, make
# a copy of the $ASHS_ROOT/bin/ashs_config.sh, edit the copy, and pass the
# copy to the ashs_main or ashs_train scripts using the -C flag. 

# -------------------------------------
# ASHS configuration and parameter file
# -------------------------------------
#
# The hemispheres in which ASHS segmentation is performed. By default this is 
# "left right" but can be set to "left" or "right" if you only need one side.
# The user must still supply the left and right segmentations to the training 
# in the manifest file
ASHS_SIDES="left right"

# -------------------------------------
# ASHS preprocessing parameters
# -------------------------------------
#
# ASHS provide options for non-local mean denoising and super resolution
# upsampling (code provided by Dr. Jose Manj√≥n http://personales.upv.es/jmanjon/).
# Currently, the non-local mean upsampling only support postive interger upsample factors.
# Upsample factors are specified in "lef-right (LR), anterior-posterior (AP), and superior-inferior (SI)" directions in the physical space rather than in x, y, z coordinates
ASHS_MPRAGE_DENOISE=0
ASHS_MPRAGE_SRUPSAMPLE=0
ASHS_MPRAGE_SRUPSAMPLE_FACTOR="1 1 1"

ASHS_TSE_SRUPSAMPLE_FACTOR="1 1 1"

# ---------------------------------
# ASHS_TSE resolution-related parameters
# ---------------------------------
#
# The default parameters are configured for ASHS_TSE images with 0.4 x 0.4 x 2.0
# voxel resolution, with a field of view that extends past the skull in the
# oblique coronal plane. If your data is different, you may want to change 
# these parameters

# The resampling factor to make data isotropic. The data does not have to be
# exactly isotropic. I suggest keeping all numbers multiples of 100. 
ASHS_TSE_ISO_FACTOR="100x100x100%"

# The cropping applied to the ASHS_TSE volume before rigid registration to the T1
# volume. If the field of view in the ASHS_TSE images is limited, you may want to
# change this. Default crops 20% of the image in the oblique coronal plane
ASHS_TSE_ISO_REGION_CROP="20x20x0% 60x60x100%"

# ----------------------------------
# ASHS_TSE-ASHS_MPRAGE registration parameters
# ----------------------------------

# The search parameters for FLIRT. You may want to play with these if the
# rigid alignment of T1 and T2 is failing. You can always override the results
# for any given image manually by performing the registration yourself and
# calling ASHS with the -N flag (to not rerun existing registrations)
ASHS_FLIRT_MULTIMODAL_OPTS="-searchrx -5 5 -searchry -5 5 -searchrz -5 5 -coarsesearch 3 -finesearch 1 -searchcost normmi"

# These are the flags for the additional affine registration between modalities.
# The purpose of additional affine registration is to take care the residule misalignment
# of each side (mainly for MTL segmentation). This is by default disabled.
ASHS_CHUNK_AFFINE=0
ASHS_SKIP_CHUNK_AFFINE=1

# ------------------------------------------------
# ASHS_MPRAGE template creation/registration parameters
# ------------------------------------------------
#
# These parameters affect registration to the template space in ashs_main and
# template construction in ashs_train

# The number of iterations when registering ASHS_MPRAGE to the template.
# This is one of the main parameters affecting the runtime of the program,
# since this is the only whole-brain registration performed by ASHS.

# Number of stages for template building, total and for rigid registration

# The amount of dilation applied to the average hippocampus mask in order to
# create a registration mask.
ASHS_TEMPLATE_ROI_DILATION="10x10x10vox"

# The size of the margin applied to the above registration mask when creating
# the ROI-specific template. This option only affects ashs_train. You can
# specify this in vox or mm units.
ASHS_TEMPLATE_ROI_MARGIN="4x4x4vox"

# The target resolution of the template (only when building a template with
# ashs_train). This is specified in units of mm. The target resolulion should
# roughly match the in-plane resolution of the ASHS_TSE data, but there is no hard
# rule for this. Setting it too high will slow everything down.
ASHS_TEMPLATE_TARGET_RESOLUTION="0.4688x0.4688x0.4688mm"

# When creating a mask to define the template, we average the input segmentations
# and set a threshold. When there are lots of atlases, 0.5 is reasonable, but for
# smaller atlas sets, this should be reduced
ASHS_TEMPLATE_MASK_THRESHOLD=0.5

# -----------------------------
# Histogram matching parameters
# -----------------------------
#

# The atlas (index into the list of atlases) used as the target for histogram
# matching. This is only used in ashs_train, and the selected atlas is copied
# into the ref_hm directory. By default, the first atlas is used
ASHS_TARGET_ATLAS_FOR_HISTMATCH=0

# The number of control points for histogram matching. See c3d -histmatch
# command. This is used for atlas building and application. In some cases 
# (for example 7T data with large intensity range) histogram matching seems
# to fail. You can set ASHS_HISTMATCH_CONTROLS to 0 turn off matching.
ASHS_HISTMATCH_CONTROLS=5


# -----------------------------------------------
# Pairwise multi-modality registration parameters
# -----------------------------------------------

# The number of Greedy iterations for running pairwise registration
#   - These parameters are for voxel size of 0.4x0.4x2.0 and should be
#   - changed when voxel size is larger and the ROI is similar size. For
#   - whole hippocampus T1 MRI for example, suggest 60x60

# step size (-e 0.5), smoothing (-s 2vox 0.6vox), etc.
ASHS_PAIRWISE_GREEDY_OPTIONS="-e 1.0 -s 2.0vox 0.6vox"

# The relative weight given to the T1 image in the pairwise registration
# Setting this to 0 makes the registration only use the ASHS_TSE images, which
# may be the best option. This has not been tested extensively. Should be 
# a floating point number between 0 and 1
ASHS_PAIRWISE_T1_WEIGHT=0

# The amount of smoothing applied to label images before warping them,
# can either be in millimeters (mm) or voxels (vox)
ASHS_LABEL_SMOOTHING="0.24mm"

# Label fusion strategy. This is the -m parameter to the label_fusion command
# I would stick to the defaults

# Patch size (specified as radius) for patch search on the MALF method. This is
# the size of the patch used to compute similarity between voxels.
ASHS_MALF_PATCHRAD="3x3x1"

# Neighborhood size (specified as radius) for patch search. This is the range
# where we search for matching patches
ASHS_MALF_SEARCHRAD="3x3x1"

# Padding for the T2 images - this is useful to set to something like 0x0x2 for
# situations where you expect segmentation to go all the way to the very last
# slice of the T2 image. This adds a modest cost to the segmentation
ASHS_MALF_PADDING="0x0x2"


# -----------------------------------------------
# AdaBoost Bias Correction Parameters
# -----------------------------------------------

# result to determine the ROI where error correction takes place. We assume
# that all the errors made by the automatic method are in this ROI.

# values speed up training
ASHS_EC_TARGET_SAMPLES=100000

# The sampling ratio used during the AdaBoost training dry run to determine 
# the total number of samples. This should only be changed if your segmentations

# in the adaboost training stage. In that case, lower this value
